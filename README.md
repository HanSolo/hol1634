This repository contains code examples for the JavaOne 2016 hands on lab 1634 "Customize your JavaFX Controls".
In the root folder you will find a resources folder that also contains templates for
* Region based controls
* Control + Skin based controls
In the resources folder you will also find templates of those files for NetBeans and IntelliJ IDEA (/IDE folder).
You can copy those templates and add them as file templates in either NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA.
